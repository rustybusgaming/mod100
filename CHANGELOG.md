# Changelog

All notable changes to Localized Weather will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Directional thunder sounds — thunder plays from the direction of nearby storm zones with proximity-based volume
- Weather zone drift — global wind direction slowly rotates, weather fronts propagate from upwind neighbors
- Wind-direction cloud drift — storm clouds now move with the wind instead of fixed X-axis
- Public Weather API (`LocalWeatherAPI`) for other mods to query weather at any position or zone

### Changed
- Storm cloud renderer uses server-synced wind direction for drift

- Smooth 20-second transitions between weather states
- Bilinear blending of rain/fog/sky across zone boundaries
